**Application Features**
>
1. The application should display a list of videos in a horizontal carousel on the
home page, which should be scrollable.
2. The user should be able to select a video to play in full screen.
3. When the video is finished, the application should go back to the previous
page.
4. The application should be navigable by both the mouse and keyboard, i.e.
navigate using the arrow keys and enter to select.
5. The user should be able to see a list of videos they have previously
watched.
6. The application UI must be responsive to changes in the browser window /
screen sizes. You do not need to implement a mobile view but it should at
least adjust based on the desktop browser width.
